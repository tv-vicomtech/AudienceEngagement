# multi-object-tracker
object detection using deep learning and multi-object tracking 

The work here is based on the following literature available:
1. http://elvera.nue.tu-berlin.de/files/1517Bochinski2017.pdf
2. https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/23/simple-object-tracking-with-opencv/
3. https://github.com/Wenuka/correlationTracker
4. [Caffemodel zoo](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html)
5. [Caffemodel zoo GitHub](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models)

Use the caffemodel zoo from the reference [4,5] mentioned above to vary the CNN models and Play around with the codes.

### Install OpenCV
Pip install for OpenCV (version 3.4.3 or later) is available [here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and can be done with the following command:

`pip install opencv-contrib-python`




NOTE: The algorithm shared in this repository was programmed and tested on Windows PC.
